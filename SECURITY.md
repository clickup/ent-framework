# Security

Keeping our clients' data secure is an absolute top priority at ClickUp. Our goal is to provide a secure environment, while also being mindful of application performance and the overall user experience.

ClickUp believes effective disclosure of security vulnerabilities requires mutual trust, respect, transparency and common good between ClickUp and Security Researchers. Together, our vigilant expertise promotes the continued security and privacy of ClickUp customers, products, and services.

If you think you've found a security vulnerability in any ClickUp-owned repository, please let us know as outlined below.

ClickUp defines a security vulnerability as an unintended weakness or exposure that could be used to compromise the integrity, availability or confidentiality of our products and services.

## Our Commitment to Reporters

- **Trust**. We maintain trust and confidentiality in our professional exchanges with security researchers.
- **Respect**. We treat all researchers with respect and recognize your contribution for keeping our customers safe and secure.
- **Transparency**. We will work with you to validate and remediate reported vulnerabilities in accordance with our commitment to security and privacy.
- **Common Good**. We investigate and remediate issues in a manner consistent with protecting the safety and security of those potentially affected by a reported vulnerability.

## What We Ask of Reporters

- **Trust**. We request that you communicate about potential vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, providing sufficient time and information for our team to validate and address potential issues.
- **Respect**. We request that researchers make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing.
- **Transparency**. We request that researchers provide the technical details and background necessary for our team to identify and validate reported issues, using the form below.
- **Common Good**. We request that researchers act for the common good, protecting user privacy and security by refraining from publicly disclosing unverified vulnerabilities until our team has had time to validate and address reported issues.

## Vulnerability Reporting

ClickUp recommends that you share the details of any suspected vulnerabilities across any asset owned, controlled, or operated by ClickUp (or that would reasonably impact the security of ClickUp and our users) using our vulnerability disclosure form at <http://clickup.com/bug-bounty>. The ClickUp Security team will acknowledge receipt of each valid vulnerability report, conduct a thorough investigation, and then take appropriate action for resolution.
