# Class: `abstract` VCFlavor

VCFlavor is some piece of info which is transitively attached to a VC and is
preserved when VC derivation (upgrade/downgrade) is happening. This piece of
info may be just an object of a separate class with no data (acts like a
boolean flag), or it can be an object with payload.

For each flavor type, only a single VCFlavor object may exist.
